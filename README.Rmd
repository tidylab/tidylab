## Overview

The tidylab is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common
data representations and API design. The __tidylab__ package is designed to make
it easy to install and load core packages from the tidylab in a single command.

## Installation

```{r installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("tidylab")
# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tidylab/tidylab")
```

## Usage

`library(tidylab)` will load the core tidylab packages: 

* [decorators](https://tidylab.github.io/decorators/), for extending the behaviour of a function without explicitly modifying it.
* [microservices](https://tidylab.github.io/microservices/), for breaking down a monolithic application to a suite of services.
* [usethat](https://tidylab.github.io/usethat/), for automating repetitive tasks that arise during analytic project setup and development.

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r example, echo = TRUE}
library(tidylab)
```

You can see conflicts created later with `tidylab_conflicts()`:

```{r conflicts, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(MASS)
tidylab_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all tidylab packages are up-to-date with `tidylab_update()`:

```{r update, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
tidylab_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * broom (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * DBI   (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#>  * Rcpp  (0.12.6 -> 0.12.7)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```
